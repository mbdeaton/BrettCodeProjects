3.8.12
It appears the new table (made with SPECEOSdriver) is also questionable.
Comparing max mass stars with Evan, we have a discrepancy (both of us
are using tables we made from HShen*20111026*h5).

Evan's (not sure if he's at table bottom, T0=0.01MeV or my request, T1=0.1MeV)
rhoc  = 1.3725e15g/cc     = 0.0022221
mgrav = 2.21401656
mbary = 2.55993894
rNS   = 12.6200000km      = 8.546

Mine, as of am 3.8.12, Thr (diff between T0 and T1 is only in rNS)
rhoc  = 1.35e15g/cc       = 0.00219
mgrav = 2.224
mbary = 2.567
rNS   = 12.7km            = 8.61    (T=T0=0.01MeV)
rNS   = 12.9km            = 8.74    (T=T1=0.1MeV)

However, I'm still working on this, and talking with Evan. I'm starting to solve
new ID with this table even though, I've got questions.

Turns out there was a bug. Pretty significant. Energy and Pressure were being
set off of beta-equilibrium by a few lines that should have been housed in an if
statement, to be used only when making a micro table. But they were called
universally.

I've moved some copies of the old (wrong) cold beta-equilibrium tables in here for
comparisons and reference.

Thus, wer're making new tables, starting new initial data (even for the LS220 case)
and starting to evolve the inspirals for the Neutrino Leakage paper from scratch.
