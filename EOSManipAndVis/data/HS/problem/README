2.25.12
I've got a new table made from the HShen EOS v2.0 a week ago. This has brought to light some
problems, perhaps related. The first problem I saw with the LS220 table also, but did not pursue
it back when I was initially using that table.

Integrating the TOV equations with a table (I've tried both HShen and LS220) seems to intruduce
a discontinuity at the surface. At the scale of rho=1e-10, the monotonically decreasing pressure
suddenly vanishes (going to exactly zero), for a few integration points, then comes back to nearly
the same level. What's going on here?

This may have something to do with a further problem which is the stellar radius calculation made by
TOVSolution. R_{*}(rho) does not change smoothly. On the scale of ~5% in r, and about ~0.1% in rho_c,
it jumps pretty wildly. These jumps do not seem to converge with resolution in the derived table
(that is when I change nr in EOSdriver/driver.F90.

Tests:
Table resolution
	450 vs 2000 points in rho (HShen_ColdTable vs HShen_ColdTable-highres.input)
	discoveries: changed where the jumps in the tovsequence occured, did not look convergent
Stellar profiles
	found 3 stars (rho_cs) living on one of these jumps in the tovsequence and made profiles.
	Mass,rho largest to smallest: a,b,c; radius largest to smallest: c,b,a
	discoveries: the surface discontinuity (P,rho vanishing and reappearing) appears in all 3
		at rho~8e-10. Pressure declines much more steeply in star a after the glitch.
PlotEOS
	looked at the EOS in rho vs eps,h,P,cs2 just to see if anything weird showed up
	discoveries: nothing strange. No glitches around rho~8e-10. However, I did notice that
		there is a much lower negative internal energy for LS than HShen (at low rho).
