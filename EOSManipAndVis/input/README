8.23.11

Two main parent LS tables are here, derived in different ways from the LS220 H5 tables.
	LS_betaeq.input
		BetaEq style table.
		The first table I used, for experiments with spectral fits to the table
		with 250 points in rho.
		Covers a smaller range in rho.
	LS_ColdTable.input
		ColdTable style table.
		The second table I used, for experiments with AppendPolytrope with 450
		points in rho (LS_Gamma2_appended_ColdTable.input).
		Covers a bigger range in rho.
Both of these tables, however, cover the essential ranges in rho ~[1.6e-3,1e-10], for a
star with rho_c=0.0013.

I've now added Matt's Cold table too.
	LS220_cbEoShr.dat
	from /panfs/ds06/sxs/mduez/LS/LS220_cbEoShr.dat. ColdTable style table.
And his full microphysical table
	LS220_EoS.dat
	from /panfs/ds06/sxs/mbdeaton/EsOS
	Tabulated style table

I've also added a higher precision appended polytrope table (LS_Gamma2_appended_ColdTable-highprec.input)
which removes the steplike features in the low-density range of the original table. This is
the table that I should use from now on.

2.22.12
I've added the shen tables I made from the new Hong Shen table on stellarcollapse.org:
HShen_ColdTable.input    cold 1d table, the one I use to make appended polytropes, etc
HShen_EoS.dat            full 3d table, lower res and smaller ranges in rho,T,Ye
HShen_MuX.dat            chemical potentials
HShen_Ye.dat             cold beta equilibrium 1d table

2.29.12
I've moved a bunch of tables around (squirreled several away into dir
OldTables). Also renamed some tables with a more generic convention:
every table is a *dat file, the full name is given (e.g. LS220 not LS),
and after "_" the type of table is named with correct capitalizations.
