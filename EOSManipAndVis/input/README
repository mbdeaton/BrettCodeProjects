8.23.11

Two main parent LS tables are here, derived in different ways from the LS220 H5 tables.
	LS_betaeq.input
		BetaEq style table.
		The first table I used, for experiments with spectral fits to the table
		with 250 points in rho.
		Covers a smaller range in rho.
	LS_ColdTable.input
		ColdTable style table.
		The second table I used, for experiments with AppendPolytrope with 450
		points in rho (LS_Gamma2_appended_ColdTable.input).
		Covers a bigger range in rho.
Both of these tables, however, cover the essential ranges in rho ~[1.6e-3,1e-10], for a
star with rho_c=0.0013.

I've now added Matt's Cold table too.
	LS220_cbEoShr.dat
	from /panfs/ds06/sxs/mduez/LS/LS220_cbEoShr.dat. ColdTable style table.
And his full microphysical table
	LS220_EoS.dat
	from /panfs/ds06/sxs/mbdeaton/EsOS
	Tabulated style table

11.23.11
I've also added a higher precision appended polytrope table (LS_Gamma2_appended_ColdTable-highprec.input)
which removes the steplike features in the low-density range of the original table. This is
the table that I should use from now on.
