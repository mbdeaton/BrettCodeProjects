I've got a number of different tables and input files dancing around in here:

Table input files for BetaEq EOS
      derived from the h5 tables directly (via Matt's EOS driver)
Table input files for ColdTable EOS
      either derived from my SpectralFit to the tables above (via ConvertToTable)
      or     derived from tabulated eoss with a polytrope affixed (via AppendPolytropeCrust)
Coefficient files for my SpectralFitEOS.
