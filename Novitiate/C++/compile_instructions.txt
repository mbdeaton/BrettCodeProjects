// Command Line Compiling of C++ Programs
// Brett Deaton 5.18.10

// I haven't yet figured out the options to use gcc to compile a C++
//	program on this machine.
//	Another convention for C++ extensions is .cpp.

// *** Single File Programs ***

// Simple compile of a single file, foo.cc. Generates an executable in
//	the working directory called a.out.
g++ <foo.cc>

// Specify the name of the executable, or target: program.
g++ -o <program> <foo.cc>

// *** Multiple File Programs ***

// There are two major stages to generating an executable: compilation
//	and linking. With multiple files, you must be explicit about the
//	linking stage. This can be done two ways:
// 1) Do it all in one fell swoop. (One file has to be named main.cc?)
g++ -o <program> <foo.cc> <main.cc>
// 2) Do it in two steps: a) create the object files, which will be
//	named foo.o and main.o in this example, b) link them into
//	an executable.
g++ -c <foo.cc>
g++ -c <main.cc>
g++ -o <program> <foo.o> <main.o>

// If you also have a header file, then there are more complicated steps.
//	And if you reference a library, then you have to point g++ to
//	that library with the -l(?) option.
