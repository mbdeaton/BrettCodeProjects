Executing Python Scripts
Brett Deaton 5.18.10

*** Running a script directly ***
--> Run python with the file foo.py as an argument
python <foo.py>
--> Or within IDLE you can run and edit a python script beautifully.

*** Generating an executable from a python script ***
--> I don't know how to do this yet

*** Making the script executable by calling it by name at the command line
--> Insert hashbang '#!' at the very beginning of the script, followed by
    the absolute path to the interpreter: '/opt/local/bin/python'. That is:
#!/opt/local/bin/python
