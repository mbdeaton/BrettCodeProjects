# Brett's Little Book of Codes

A repository for small-scale code projects.

### Overview

**Arduino**.
Personal microcontroller projects (from Spring 2022).

**AstroFluids**.
Code projects from Matt Duez's astrophysical fluids class (Fall 2011).

**CodeClub**.
Infrastructure and practice problems from SEL Code Club (Fall 2019).

**DailyCodingProb**.
Solutions to problems from the
[Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com) email list.

**WebApps**.
Self-learning JavaScript/React projects (Fall 2021 ff).

**Jupyter**.
Personal Jupyter notebooks (2020 ff).

**NeutrinoAnnihilation**.
Some early tests of the MonteCarlo integration routines to tune the adaptive
algorithm parameters (2012). This eventually turned into the production
NeutrinoRayTracing code in the
[Spectral Einstein Codebase](https://www.black-holes.org/code/SpEC.html).

**ProjectEuler**.
Solutions or attempts to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

**ScriptRefConfig**.
Useful scripts, references, and config files.

**Miscellany**.
Crap, junk, pearls.
