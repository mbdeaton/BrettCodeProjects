# Brett's Little Book of Codes
A repository for small-scale code projects.

### Overview

__AstroFluids__.
Code projects from Matt Duez's astrophysical fluids class (Fall 2011).

__CodeClub__.
Infrastructure and practice problems from SEL Code Club (Fall 2019).

__DailyCodingProb__.
Solutions to problems from the
[Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com) email list.

__JavaScript__.
Self-learning JavaScript projects (Fall 2021 ff).

__Jupyter__.
Personal Jupyter notebooks (2020 ff).

__NeutrinoAnnihilation__.
Some early tests of the MonteCarlo integration routines to tune the adaptive
algorithm parameters (2012). This eventually turned into the production
NeutrinoRayTracing code in the
[Spectral Einstein Codebase](https://www.black-holes.org/code/SpEC.html).

__Novitiate__.
Any code/computing references and any early attempts and experiments
(2010 ff).

__ProjectEuler__.
Solutions or attempts to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.
