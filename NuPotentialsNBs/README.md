# Mathematica Notebooks for Calculating Neutrino Potentials

We use `nu_potentials*.nb`  to compute neutrino flavor Hamiltonian
self-interaction potentials from the output generated by the exec
`ComputeDistribFunction` in `$SPECHOME/Hydro/Neutrinos/NeutrinoRayTracing`.
Additionally, these notebooks compute the matter potential.

Several versions exist, for calculations from different inputs.

* `nu_and_matter_potentials_simulation*.nb`.
  This is for computing V_nunu and V_e from ray tracing output and
  Rodrigo Fernandez's disk wind simulations.
* `nu_and_matter_potentials_analytic*.nb`
  This if for computing V_nunu and V_e from ray tracing output and
  Rebecca Surman's phenomenological wind model.

# ToDo
These items need work

* Clean up the history and notebook caching so that you can effectively diff,
  (which is important for versioning also). See this helpful discussion on
  [stackexchange](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/11258/are-there-suitable-versioning-systems-for-mathematica-notebooks).
