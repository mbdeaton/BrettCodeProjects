11.26.11
A git repository for code and related developments. Use as a raw code repo for research
and classes, and link to these dirs from more structured paths elsewhere (if so desired).

Some of these child dirs are not git added--if they're taken from another repo (SpecClass2011),
or if they're unedited code from another project (GR1D). To keep dir foo from being tracked
add "foo/" to the .git/info/exclude file.

In the Novitiate dir are any code/computing references and any early attempts and experiments.
