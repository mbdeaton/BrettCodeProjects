1.14.12
Neutrino-Antineutrino Annihilation Energy Deposition Code
I'm using GSL monte carlo libraries to integrate the 6D energy dep integral.

1.20.12
Codes thusfar:
TestMonteCarlo2D
	integrate a simple 2D integrand to test 3 monte carlo methods:
	plain, miser, vegas
TestMonteCarlo6D
	integrate the same integrand extended to 6D
ComputeNuAnnihilation1
	integrate a piecewise constant separable distribution function (6D),
	sort of like the distribution functions we'll encounter in the more
	realistic simulation. Also include all the correct factors for the
	energy deposition integral.
ComputeNuAnnihilation2
	integrate separable but more realistic distribution functions

1.31.12
I created a new dir called StandAloneTests and put the above code into it. I also updated the
ComputeNuAnnihilationTests to reflect my improved understanding of the integrand, its
dimensional constant, and the need to scale it to order unity. These tests still pass.

Also started new driver, ComputeNuAnnihilationSinglePoint, which will wrap my soon-to-come-
into-existence classes, NewAnnihilationIntegral (and its children NAIMiser, NAIVegas),
GSLMonteCarlo classes (which will wrap the gsl c-code and give it cleaner handles),
NuDistributionFunction (and its children NDFPiecewiseConstant, NDFSeparableAnalytic,
NDFRayTraceNu, NDFRayTraceNubar).

2.1.12
Started migrating to SpEC coding paradigm, with SpEC Makefile and including SpEC structures,
also placing all executables in dir Executables. For future code here, separate class definitions
and implementations in to hpp and cpp files.
