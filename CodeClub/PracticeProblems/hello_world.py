#  OUT   He answers to the pronouns he/him.
#  OUT   His handle is "fyodor".
#  OUT   His favorite thing to cook is grilled steak.

# the task:
#   1) extend the print statements to multiple lines describing yourself,
#   2) figure out how to retrieve the current date,
#   3) figure out how to print a quotation mark, ".
