# Your task is to build a script that queries the user's birthdate (i.e. year,
# month, day), and prints some facts about their age. The minimal user interface
# might go something like this:
#   OUT  in what year were you born (e.g. 2019)?
#   IN   1983
#   OUT  in what month (e.g. 12)?
#   IN   11
#   OUT  on what day of the month (e.g. 31)?
#   IN   14
#   OUT  you were born in November
#   OUT  you are 35.7 years old
