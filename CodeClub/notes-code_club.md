# Coding Club
Brett's and Anthony's notes begun June 2019.

## Overview
We're trying to develop a coding community at the Lewiston factory by meeting
weekly off the clock to work help each other with programming problems. We're
focusing on Python 3, but are open to solutions and discussions in any language.

Meeting structure:
* Use Fundamentals laptops.
* Meet weekly for 1 hr in the computer lab.
* Weekday meeting times: ~~Tue 1:45-2.45 (swing) and~~ 3.15-4.15 (day)

## History
Newest history goes toward the top.

#### Oct 2019
Tanner is leaving SEL, and we decided to pause day shift code club also.
It had only been Tanner and Joe.

#### Sep 2019
We agreed to pause swing shift code club, but Tanner was going to continue
leading day shift code club.

#### Plan for Aug 2019
Brett's last day before family leave is July 26; Anthony's last day at Lewiston
factory is Aug 1. Chip will be able to participate and help lead for the first
two weeks of Aug, but club presidents Raul Delioth and Brandon Lunney will
take responsibility for sending weekly invites, assigning the weekly problem,
and facilitating the meetings. Anthony, Chip, and I will write a set of 5-6
problems for Raul and Brandon to use in our absence.

#### Brett's reboot email (7.25.19)
After a month of code club we're going to change a few things based on your
feedback. First, instead of math-rich problems from projecteuler.net, we're
going to pick fun problems that address basic programming concepts. And second,
instead of wrestling with a problem solo between meetings, we're going to start
each meeting with a script fragment that works but doesn't solve the problem,
and we'll work together to expand the script during code club.

Don't worry if you don't have a laptop with a python interpreter: we'll be
using the SEL laptops in the computer lab. Don't worry if you don't know the
first thing about python: most of us don't, we're learning together. Don't
worry if you miss a week or several: we'll be exploring the basics for months
to come. Don't worry if you get stuck on something: club is a workshop, we'll
help each other get unstuck.

The purpose of code club is to learn to code with friends. It's for learners
not experts. So come help us build a coding community in Lewiston!

Note 1: Next week's meetings are as usual in the computer lab 1.45-2.45 and
3.15-4.15. As described above, there's no problem to solve beforehand. Just come
and code.

Note 2: Don't hesitate to contact me or Anthony if you want off this email list.

#### Brett's suggested Style Guide (7.1.19)
One other bit of structure I think we could provide is a short description
of what a good solution to a programming problem looks like. I'd love to
brainstorm that with you. Here's a rough draft:

Whether I use a TI-83, python, or a handwritten algorithm (i.e. pseudocode), a
good solution is readable, open, and robust.
1. Readable: by others familiar with the language (and myself a month from now).
   Present the solution in an orderly form. Name the variables and functions
   descriptively and add comments if necessary. For example, in an Excel
   solution label the cells and design the spreadsheet so the reader's eye
   focuses on the input, output, and adjustable parameters.
2. Open: to others' editing and reuse. Create your solution to be shared.
   Generalize your solution so it can solve similar problems others might face.
   For example, in an Excel solution compute everything using Excel functions
   rather than entering parts of your solution by hand.
3. Robust: against erroneous misuse. Design your solution to be usable by a
   fool. Guard against input errors. For example, in an Excel solution,
   automatically highlight an input cell when the user enters an unexpected
   value, or display multiple outputs for each significant step of the
   computation so the user is alerted to weird results.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these ideas. I only started thinking about
this today. I think the purpose of a style guide like this should be to nurture
a sharing culture, since coding is communicating. But I'd hate for it to be
intimidating, and frighten anyone away from taking a first guerilla hack at a
problem. Maybe the zeroth principle in the style guide is "just solve the damn
thing." Maybe a style guide like this is something we develop as a club over
time.

P.S. I found this wonderful nugget while doing a little research on what makes
for good code: "Programming is an art of telling another human what one wants
the computer to do." - Donald Knuth. Knuth wrote (or actually, is writing) the
bible on algorithms.

#### Anthony's initial invitation email (6.25.19)
Hello everyone!

Are you interested in the fine art of computer programming?
Looking for a way to familiarize yourself with the basics?
Wanting to sharpen your problem solving skills?
Then do we have the group for you!

Brett and I have been discussing a once a week before or after work coding club
where all those who are interested can get together and collaborate on solving
programming problems. We have some ideas on what this could look like, but we
really want to hear from you what you would like to see in this kind of setting!
To help us get a good idea as to what would make this beneficial to everyone,
please answer the following questions by Friday. We will use this information to
tailor our meetings to the group and make sure we can accommodate as many people
as possible.

* Why do you want to join a coding club?
* What experience do you have with computer programming (hobby, school,
  professional, other)?
* What programming languages are you familiar with?
* What times outside of work would be best for meeting?
* Do you have your own laptop or would you prefer one be provided?

Because next week is a holiday, we may schedule our first official meeting the
week after, but I would like to have an informal meeting as soon as next week
to meet all of you face to face and hash out some details.

I look forward to hearing from all of you!

#### Jake Schlosser's Input (6.27.19)
* keep it work-unrelated since it's off the clock
* keep it off the clock right now, maybe later, if the value added to our
  factory becomes clear, we can reexamine the idea of on the clock
* keep him informed, but do it anywhere (on- or off-site) and anytime

#### Original Structure June/July 2019
We're going to use the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems as a
context to learn programming together. We are focusing on a single language,
[python3](https://docs.python.org/3) for beginners' sakes, but our club is
language agnostic: solve the problem with a TI-83 if you wish.

Our meeting structure is:
* Use Fundamentals laptops.
* Meet weekly for 1 hr in the computer lab; extra meeting hosted by Anthony on
  the weekend at the LCSC library (?).
* Weekday meeting times: Tue 1:45-2.45 (swing) and 3.15-4.15 (day)
* Work on a single problem at a time.
* Brett's proposed schedule:
  * 5 min applications discussion: "what applications interest you?"
  * 20 min share solutions and discuss code structures
  * 20 min brainstorm new problem
  * 5 min debrief: "how'd today's meeting go?"
* Laminate python cheat sheets as club assets.
